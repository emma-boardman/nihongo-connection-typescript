## Interactions

## A11y 

- Link text must be helpful (i.e. tells the user where they're going and why, avoiding "click here", "read more")

- If telling people to do something, link text should start with a verb ("apply for a ...")

## Content 

Button text is currently handled in the code-base, and is passed to the button as a string of text. 

## Customisation

## Future work

- refactor the action button logic in the mailchimp component, which will likely affect the action button component props. 
- improve aesthetic of focus states
